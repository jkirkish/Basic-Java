		/*The for Loop:

A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently
 write a loop that needs to execute a specific number of times.
A for loop is useful when you know how many times a task is to be repeated.

Syntax:

The syntax of a for loop is:
for(initialization; Boolean_expression; update)
{
   //Statements
}

Here is the flow of control in a for loop:
The initialization step is executed first, and only once. This step allows you 
to declare and initialize any loop control variables. You are not required to 
put a statement here, as long as a semicolon appears.
Next, the Boolean expression is evaluated. If it is true, the body of the loop 
is executed. If it is false, the body of the loop does not execute and flow of 
control jumps to the next statement past the for loop.
After the body of the for loop executes, the flow of control jumps back up to 
the update statement. This statement allows you to update any loop control variables. 
This statement can be left blank, as long as a semicolon appears after the Boolean 
expression.The Boolean expression is now evaluated again. If it is true, the loop 
executes and the process repeats itself (body of loop, then update step, then Boolean expression). 
After the Boolean expression is false, the for loop terminates.
